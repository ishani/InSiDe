InSiDe
======

A utility for importing artwork from external editors into Jason Rohrer's 2-player storytelling game, [Sleep Is Death](http://sleepisdeath.net/). 

* Import images as backgrounds, sprites or objects with options over slicing and subdivision
* Assemble and manage resource packs for distributing your SiD work
* Root through the SiD cache to extract any useful items for collection into packs (or delete old things you no longer want)

The *SiDCore* library is a standalone component that allows easy manipulation of SiD resource entities, should one wish to write other custom tools for SiD.
